Your application has users from multiple timezones. And you want to send them an email at their local time. Let’s say you want to send an email to the users on 31 December 2019 at 11:00 AM. All users from different timezones will receive the email at their 11:00 AM (on 31 December 2019). Suppose your application has the “Asia/Dhaka” and “America/Costa_Rica” users, Bangladeshi users will receive the email at BST 11:00 AM and American users will receive the email at US 11:00 AM. You don’t have to implement the email sending mechanism, just console.log the timezone(s)
